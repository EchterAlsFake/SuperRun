# Super Run

Super Run is a 2D jump'n run Python game developed using the Pygame library.
> You can't play it currently!

# What's up with this project?

In our school we have something called "Freies Lernen." (Free-time learning) Basically, students can group together and over one year
they create something. So there are like 1â€“2 days per month when you have time to do this, and I and my group decided
to develop a 2D Game.

We started using the Unreal Engine, but it quickly turned out that this wasn't a good idea, so we are using pure
Python with the pygame library.

The purpose of all this is to learn something new, so we all don't know how to develop a game, but we will learn it here.
You can expect errors, bugs and a lot of other stuff, but it's an interesting project for all of us.

If you want to help us, you can, but please don't write the whole game for us. That would be out of scope xD
